<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">Foreword</span></h2>
<p>Most species of the smaller birds which nest in hollow trees,
and therefore in bird houses, suffer seriously from intrusion
by English Sparrows and European Starlings. These two
species, nesting in similar locations and being prolific, tend to take up all
available nesting cavities, even ejecting native birds which have built or
begun to build. This condition, already serious, may become far more
baneful than we are as yet able to realize. It may even contribute to the
eventual extinction of Bluebirds, Crested Flycatchers, and Purple Martins
unless we provide nesting sites sufficient in number and suitable in
kind for all. The number of natural nesting sites is already far below
that required by these birds, and yet the Starlings in particular are increasing
alarmingly. There is no way to determine when a final adjustment
or balance will be reached or what the numerical status of our native
bird-house dwellers will be when such balance shall have been attained.</p>
<p>In the case of the native species named above, we can at least help by
providing proper nesting boxes which will induce the birds to concentrate
about our houses, where the European Starling and the English
Sparrow menace may be more easily and effectively met than elsewhere.
The reader should note that the imported English Sparrow, which is in
reality a weaver finch and unrelated to our tuneful native sparrows, is the
only &ldquo;sparrow&rdquo; east of the Rocky Mountains that nests in holes or bird
houses. The shyer, more desirable, native species are invariably harmless
and should be both protected and encouraged.</p>
<p>The smaller of the bird-house species, such as the House Wren, Tree
Swallow, Black-capped Chickadee, White-breasted Nuthatch, and Tufted
Titmouse are less affected by the intruders. These smaller birds can use,
and usually select, cavities with openings too small for either Starling or
English Sparrow to enter. However, there is still a distinct practical advantage
in providing proper boxes for House Wrens and other small
species. In many instances these birds fail to find places safe from the
ubiquitous English Sparrow and European Starling, which then proceed
in their well-known manner to work destruction. A properly made wren
house, chickadee house, or swallow house can be absolutely safe from the
foreign invaders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>More nesting sites, properly made and situated, are desirable, owing
to the destruction of birds&rsquo; traditional nesting sites over wide acreages
about cities and other settled areas, but the providing of suitable bird
houses needs no defense or excuse. Whether it be the beautiful and demure
bluebird, &ldquo;bird of happiness,&rdquo; the sleek and immaculate swallow,
the songful wren, &ldquo;saucy and impudent,&rdquo; the bustling and industrious
chickadee, or the alert and noisy flycatcher, the native tenant of the bird
house will be an interesting and entertaining neighbor, always prompt to
pay his rent in one form or another or in many forms and with interest.
Does one need any special excuse for offering hospitality to such a
neighbor? When birds nest on our home grounds, their destruction of
garden pests, mosquitos, gnats, and other undesirable insects is concentrated
where we can most directly profit from the results&mdash;our own
greater comfort and safety, better gardens, more productive orchards,
more verdure in shade trees and in ornamental trees and shrubs.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">Bird Houses and Common Sense</span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="Illustrated capital A" width="164" height="168" />
</div>
<p>Although there are a number of points which should
be considered in the proper designing and placing of
a bird house, there is one simple idea which practically
covers the whole subject. Every species of our small
native birds that nests in a bird house nested originally in a hollow tree,
by preference in a hollow of one unvarying type&mdash;the burrow made by
a woodpecker. Thus we need only know what the burrow of a woodpecker
is like and we have automatically solved in a general way the
questions of material; size and shape of entrance; diameter, depth and
form of cavity; height above ground; and situation. The nature of nesting
material and its whereabouts should play absolutely no part in human
plans for the prospective tenants. &ldquo;Unfurnished&rdquo; rooms are the only
kind for which birds are looking.</p>
<p>There is solid ground for assuming a woodpecker&rsquo;s burrow to be the
ideal pattern for a bird house. The woodpecker, whatever its species,
free to excavate any form of chamber that it might wish, invariably uses
<i>one</i> type of burrow. The birds which by preference habitually adopt for
their own use the woodpecker&rsquo;s abandoned home have likewise thus
placed their own age-old stamp of approval on that type. It is logical to
assume, therefore, that the artificial bird house should follow at least
the general plan of that long-tried and preeminently successful nesting
site. Since a theory may be plausible while yet utterly untenable in actual
application, it remains to add that abundance of experience in building
and placing bird houses all goes to prove the foregoing basic principle
soundly correct in practice. With or without benefit of the plans and
specifications in such a bulletin as this, a person who takes his cue from
a woodpecker will not go far wrong. In planning a bird house, we must
continually hark back to the idea of the woodpecker&rsquo;s burrow&mdash;or rather,
we should never quite lose sight of it.</p>
<h3 id="c3"><i>Some Current Notions Corrected</i></h3>
<p>Attention should be called to some common misconceptions. The
colony bird house, or any bird house with more than one compartment,
is always a mistake unless it has been designed for Purple Martins. Yet
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
certain firms have for years been advertising &ldquo;wren houses&rdquo; of four or
more chambers. One who knows this pugnacious little bird tries in vain
to imagine two pairs of wrens living peaceably under one small roof!
Every bird house should consist of one, and only one, chamber&mdash;with
the single exception of a house intended for the Purple Martin, which
nests in colonies.</p>
<p>The cubic capacity of the bird houses one sees is nearly always much
too great&mdash;often several times too great. Builders seem to believe that
the diameter of the nesting chamber should at least equal the total
length of the bird&mdash;a theory as erroneous as it is plausible. <a href="#fig2">Plate I</a> illustrates
the fact that the sitting bird normally occupies a space measuring
much less from side to side than the outstretched length of the bird.
Figure No. 4, <a href="#fig2">Plate I</a>, shows how much work is often made for the
House Wren, while figure No. 5, on the same plate, shows how greatly
this work may be reduced&mdash;with the greater inducement to the prospective
occupant.</p>
<p>The square or rectangular door is another frequent mistake&mdash;a projection
of the designer&rsquo;s own plantigrade and vertical personality.</p>
<p>To place the entrance at or near floor level is also an error. Remember
that birds close no doors against drafts, that their &ldquo;beds&rdquo; are laid
on the floor and consist of light straws, feathers, or other flimsy materials.</p>
<p>Many a wren house with entrance (as it should be) too small for any
English Sparrow to enter, is hung <i>swinging from a branch</i> as a further
protection against the unwanted sparrow. That is like beheading a criminal
and then, &ldquo;just to be on the safe side,&rdquo; shooting him into the bargain!
It is said that wrens do not hesitate to use these swinging nesting sites,
but we have our serious doubts. We have personally seen one instance
of a wren nesting in the pensile home of a Baltimore Oriole, but it is
significant that in this case we failed to find any better site nearby. Some
persons report success with this type of house and prefer it because of the
ease of putting it up and taking it down without injury to a living tree.</p>
<p>Two doors, presumably entrance and exit, to a bird house of one compartment
is nearly as ridiculous an innovation as the two doors said to
have been provided by a famous scientist for the use of his old cat and
her kittens, respectively.</p>

Compare length of bird with diameter of nesting chamber. 4, A wren house, as
frequently made, of eight to ten times the necessary cubic capacity. 5, A wren

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Overcrowding is a prevalent fault. On an area insufficient properly to
harbor two pairs of wrens or bluebirds there will often be a half-dozen
or more bird houses. Tree Swallows are social birds and will occupy
boxes placed near to one another, but ordinarily, birds, especially those
of the same species, do not build near each other. It is a large town lot
which will properly accommodate more than one pair of nesting wrens.
Even the demure bluebirds do not like to build within a stone&rsquo;s throw of
each other. While the martin colony may number upward of a dozen
pairs in the same house, there may not be other martins within a mile.
There is many a small village whose single martin house accommodates
all the martins to be found within a radius of several miles.</p>
<p>The size of entrance seems often to be a stumbling block. One sees
wren houses with perfect bluebird entrances, and bluebird houses with
doorways best suited to wrens or chickadees or, at the other extreme, to
doves!</p>
<p>Although arguments, supported by some experience, have been advanced
for larger entrances, we nevertheless suggest entrances of nearly
minimum size&mdash;a suggestion based on personal experience and long familiarity
with the preferences shown by the species concerned. Apparently
John Burroughs was first to point out that when birds hesitate to
enter a small opening it is evidently because their bodies, completely
filling the entrance, render the cavity totally dark and therefore alarming.
Cut a few small auger holes to admit light, and the bird enters the now
somewhat less mysterious chamber. The holes also provide needed ventilation,
but they should be small and well above the entrance-level, for
drafts must be avoided. The entrance to the house for wren, chickadee,
or Tree Swallow should be, since it easily may be, too small to admit
English Sparrows. It is not possible to exclude English Sparrows from
houses of other birds in that way.</p>
<p>Finally, the mistake is often made of providing simply <i>a</i> bird house
instead of a <i>martin</i> house, a <i>wren</i> house, a <i>bluebird</i> house, or a house for
some other definite species. The result is that such houses usually go unoccupied
or else are promptly claimed by the first English Sparrows that
spy them. Any bird house will suit the English Sparrow if only he can
get into it, and he usually can get into <i>a</i> bird house. So avoid type <i>a</i>&mdash;the
too common variety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">General and Miscellaneous</span></h2>
<h3 id="c5"><i>Material</i></h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="Illustrated capital W" width="169" height="167" />
</div>
<p>Wood is the material par excellence for the bird house,
the only material which can be unreservedly recommended.
Substitutes have been used with varying degrees
of success or failure. What glass is for the window,
wood is for the bird house. First, the birds are habituated to it. It is
a good nonconductor of heat, it resists rain and extremes of temperature,
and it can be made to harmonize with its setting. Over a long period of
time it improves, rather than suffers, from exposure to the weather.</p>
<p>Soft wood with straight grain, such as pine or spruce, is preferable. It
is easily worked, may be nailed with little danger of serious splitting, and
is sufficiently durable. Slab wood, with or without the bark, and old fence-boards
make the most generally effective bird houses. If new lumber is
used, it should be rough, not planed; whether rough or planed, it should
be treated with gray, olive, or dull brown stain of a medium shade. There
are numbers of suitable oil stains on the market. The stain should permeate
the grain of the wood, without actually coating it as paint does.
Thickness of the boards should not be far from 1 inch. If slab wood is
used, it may be anywhere from &#8540; inch at the edge, up to about 2 inches
in the thickest part.</p>
<p>Leave the matter of materials for the nest itself entirely to the birds.
Not only is it quite unnecessary to place twigs, straws, strings, or even
choice feathers or other fluffy bits on or near the bird house, but such
action tends actually to defeat its own purpose. The prospective tenants
often seem to regard these well-meant efforts as evidence of a competitor
who has the advantage of priority. This is especially apt to be the case
when the materials are placed inside the house. Birds will sometimes
steal nesting sites and even the raw materials of others but may choose
to avoid the clash which such piracy entails, provided there are other
sites and materials not too far to seek.</p>
<h3 id="c6"><i>Entrance</i></h3>
<p>There is always danger of the wood splitting when too large an auger
hole is attempted. Before assembling the bird house, make an entrance
in the front board. Start by drawing a circle the exact size of the doorway-to-be.
Then, just inside this circle, bore four holes at equal intervals, using
a bit not larger than &#8540; inch for the smaller entrances; not larger than
&frac34; inch for the larger entrances. It will now be not too difficult, by use of
a keyhole saw or pocketknife and wood-rasp, to remove the wood still
remaining inside the drawn circle. Placing the board horizontally in a
vice will further insure against splitting while the holes are being bored.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h3 id="c7"><i>Nails</i></h3>
<p>When a bird house is fastened to a support by the &ldquo;toe-nail&rdquo; method
(by driving nails at a slant through the sides and bottom), it is a good
point first to drill holes of the right diameter to fit the nails tightly;
otherwise splitting of the sides or bottom of the house may result. Use
flat-headed nails.</p>
<h3 id="c8"><i>Slabs</i></h3>
<p>When slabs are used in house-building, the upright pieces may be
fastened to each other, at intervals of several inches, with a wire staple
having &frac34;-inch prongs one inch apart. These should be on the outside
of the house, where rust will color them to conform with the rustic wood.</p>
<h3 id="c9"><i>Facilities for House Cleaning</i></h3>
<p>For inspecting the nest and, at the end of the season, for cleaning out
the old nest material, the top or some other section of the house should
always be easily removable. Exceptions to this rule are houses for ducks
and other larger birds, for which the entrance may be large enough and
the depth not too great for all such purposes. Do not open a house in
the owner&rsquo;s presence. The more brief and infrequent your inspections,
the less they will disturb the birds.</p>
<h3 id="c10"><i>Position of Boxes</i></h3>
<p>Bird houses erected on poles are safer from predators than those placed
in trees. Houses for Purple Martins, in particular, need to be at a distance
from trees and buildings, and if possible near water.</p>
<p>Place your bird house where the sun will reach it during part of the
day, and turn the entrance away from the prevailing winds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>It seems hardly necessary to emphasize that, if possible, the bird house,
as well as the bird bath and feeding station, should be placed in full
view of a convenient window. To watch birds in their building and other
activities will prove a fascinating pleasure.</p>
<h3 id="c11"><i>Undesired Tenants</i></h3>
<p>The author once with complete success contrived and operated a mechanical
&ldquo;bouncer&rdquo; to meet a particular and aggravated instance of bird
trespassers. In case of interference with any desired tenant or prospective
tenant by rivals for the same bird house, the interfering birds may be
driven away by this device.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="354" />
<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Figure 1.</span> Discouraging the Uninvited Guest.</p>
</div>
<p>One end of a stout cord is attached at some point close below the
bird house. To this cord a rag or a piece of waxed paper about man&rsquo;s-handkerchief
size is tied as conspicuously as possible at a distance from
the fastened end of the cord about equal to the height of the bird house.
The cord&rsquo;s free end is then carried through a window of your own house
from which there is a convenient view of the bird box. The end of the
cord is fastened inside the window where it can be easily reached and
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
jerked, enough slack being allowed to let the rag at the other end hang
down. If the unwanted birds appear on or too close to the bird house,
the cord is given a sharp pull which will cause the rag to jerk upward and
frighten the intruder away. Repeat as often as occasion requires.</p>
<p>Care should be taken to work the bouncer when only the undesired
birds are within effective distance. However, should the contending birds
actually come to bodily grips on or beside the nesting site, the fight may
be broken up by vigorous operation of the alarm. The author found that
this device, exercised as occasion required, in two days ended a week-old
continuous struggle between a Bluebird and a pair of Tree Swallows in
which the Bluebird had entirely defeated the daily efforts of the Swallows
to start a nest. The Swallows were left in possession, quickly built their
nest, and duly raised their brood.</p>
<p>Obviously, this device and procedure may be applied against Starlings,
English Sparrows, or other birds, regardless of species, which for any
reason one desires to discourage from building in a given bird house or
other nesting-site.</p>
<p>The use of a rag or similar object, instead of a bell or other noisemaker,
is advised because the range of alarm is thereby limited to the
immediate location of the bird house, so that the desired tenants will not
be frightened by the operation of the alarm when they are within hearing.</p>
<h3 id="c12"><i>Thickets</i></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Reserves&rdquo; of the favorite environment are as much a need for some
species as bird houses are for others. Widespread &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; and
&ldquo;beautification&rdquo; along roadsides is destroying the thicket, the favored
haunt of Song Sparrows, Catbirds, certain warblers, quail, and other
desirable species. A &ldquo;reserve&rdquo; thicket may be located in a secluded part
of the home grounds, hidden by a hedge if considered unsightly. It may
be almost any shape, but not less than 20 feet in average diameter or
much less than 400 square feet in area. Here weeds, tall grass, briars,
and dense bushes are allowed to grow wild, forming a tangle as they will.
If the bushes include such kinds as hackberry, hawthorn, sumac, elderberry,
and chokecherry, the thicket&rsquo;s annual period of usefulness will be
extended. Including such a winter food tree as the mountain ash will
invite Purple Finches, Pine Siskins, grosbeaks, waxwings, and perhaps
crossbills.</p>

<p>Nesting in all sorts of nooks and crannies, the House
Wren is easily satisfied. Moreover, this is often the
only desirable species which can be induced to build in
so civilized and restricted a place as a small city lot.
Slab construction may be employed or old weathered

<p><a href="#fig5">Plate III</a> illustrates a wren house and gives directions for building.
Distance from the ground to the entrance of the house should be from 8
to 18 feet. The place safest from cats is on the side of a building. If the
box is on a tree or wooden post, protection is afforded by a band of
smooth sheet metal such as zinc, 2&frac12; feet high, starting not less than 4
feet from the ground or other point that is within reach of cats.</p>

thickets than to court man&rsquo;s society, is not ordinarily a bird house tenant.
Still, a home like that described for the House Wren, but with the
entrance having a diameter of 1&frac14; inch, is not unlikely to be selected by
the Carolina if placed in a brushy area frequented by him and not much
frequented by humans.</p>

<img src="images/p09a.jpg" alt="Illustrated capital L" width="159" height="159" />
</div>
<p>Lacking the semi-domestic status of wren and martin,
the Black-capped Chickadee is not a regular bird-house
addict. He prefers the seclusion of some unfrequented
wood. Yet, not uncommonly, he is enticed by a bird
house. The specifications and illustrations for the wren house will do for
the chickadee. However, a cylindrical and smaller chamber with somewhat
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
larger entrance (1&#8539; inch) is more likely to appeal to his uneducated
taste. He is still a bird &ldquo;with the bark on,&rdquo; and his house should be quite
literally in keeping. The author personally much prefers to select a hollow
branch, from which he cuts a foot-long section. He then drills an
entrance hole near one end, nails a piece of slab in place for the bottom,
provides a removable lid of the same material, and thus constitutes himself
a proxy for the Downy Woodpecker in providing the chickadee
with a home. (See <a href="#fig3">Plate II</a>.)</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="sc">Figure 2.</span> A Chickadee Family.</p>
</div>
<p>A wood lot or a neglected old orchard bordering a wood is the place
for the chickadee house. See <a href="#Page_16">Table I</a> for measurements.</p>
<h3 id="c17"><i>Other Chickadees</i></h3>
<p>The Mountain and other chickadees share the natural nesting habits
of the Black-cap. Since this group is composed of birds of practically
uniform size, a house for any species should be the same as that described
for the Black-cap.</p>
<p>However, chickadees are in general birds of the woods. Few or none
come so near to being birds of &ldquo;home grounds&rdquo; as do the Black-caps.
Houses for them, therefore, will be appropriate chiefly about woods
homes or camps.</p>

<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">The White-breasted Nuthatch</span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="Illustrated capital A" width="163" height="160" />
</div>
<p>All that has been written of the chickadee and his housing
problem applies also in a general way to the Nuthatch,
except that a slightly larger entrance is needed
for the latter bird (see measurements in <a href="#Page_16">Table I</a>).
The Nuthatch, somewhat more than his second cousins, the chickadees,
is given to natural knot-holes in living trees. This propensity may well be
humored by giving him a house of the hollowed-out trunk variety. If the
trunk or branch so hollowed out has a knot which can be made of proper
size to serve for the entrance, then that is to add the ultimate artistic
finish, the final delicate &ldquo;touch of nature.&rdquo; See <a href="#fig3">Plate II</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c19"><i>Other Nuthatches</i></h3>
<p>The western subspecies of the White-breasted Nuthatch occur chiefly
in less settled or more restricted ranges, and they are apt to be less
accustomed to, as well as less accessible for, bird houses.</p>
<p>The Red-breasted, Brown-headed, and other small nuthatches share
the hollow-tree nesting habit common to the family. They prefer locations
of the wilder kind, so that the usual bird house is not likely to entice
them away from less sophisticated haunts. Yet it appears likely that
any of the species might select an imitation of its natural nesting site.
Build as for the White-breasted, except that the entrance should be but
1&frac14; inch in diameter.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10a.jpg" alt="Illustrated capital T" width="161" height="162" />
</div>
<p>The Tufted Titmouse is common in the south, where its
distribution is also much more uniform than in the
north. In some places it has pushed far toward our
northern border, but there it is inclined to be of only
local and irregular occurrence. In general it becomes more and more a
bird of the wilder areas as it advances northward. Usually a wood or
woodside location will be the one most likely to entice this species to a
bird house. When and where the bird is found to linger about residences
toward the nesting season, the houses may be placed much as for the
bluebird or wren, but in a very quiet corner of the yard. Dimensions are
given in <a href="#Page_16">Table I</a> (<a href="#Page_16">page 16</a>). See also
Plates <a href="#fig3">II</a> and <a href="#fig5">III</a>.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10c.jpg" alt="Illustrated capital T" width="159" height="162" />
</div>
<p>The Tree Swallow is often a bird of the small city, but
may be expected more dependably in the country or
in the rural community. He is easily satisfied as to a
nesting place but it is sometimes difficult or impossible
for him to find a nook about our dwellings which is safe
from the English Sparrow&rsquo;s intrusion. When nesting about inhabited
buildings he cannot well afford to dispense with the vigilance of his human
landlords. Small, quiet, and peace-loving, he is a particularly poor
match for the pugnacious sparrow. Specifications for the Tree Swallow
house are given in <a href="#Page_16">Table I</a>. See also <a href="#fig5">Plate III</a>. The inner wall, between
floor and entrance, must be rough or provided with cleats, in order to
give the young a sure foothold. Several pairs of Tree Swallows will
willingly nest near one another.</p>
<h3 id="c22"><i>Other Swallows</i></h3>
<p>For the beautiful Violet-green Swallow build exactly as for the Tree
Swallow. Where, in the west, both species occur, there is the chance that
a house intended for the Violet-green will be taken by the Tree Swallow.
This chance, otherwise more than an even one, may be lessened by catering
to the Violet-green&rsquo;s observed choice of local haunts. Barn Swallows
will sometimes use ledges, such as those described for the Robin (<a href="#Page_29">page 29</a>),
when these are sheltered.</p>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">The Eastern Bluebird</span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10d.jpg" alt="Illustrated capital B" width="158" height="159" />
</div>
<p>Beautiful, cheerful, demure, raising two or more broods
in the season, always a picture of &ldquo;content in a cottage,&rdquo;
the Bluebird is the all-round ideal tenant for the simple
bird house. He is, however, not a bird of the city, nor
always a bird of the village garden. The suburbs, especially the more
secluded spots therein, suit him much better. He tends, and that with
ample reason, to shrink from the society of English Sparrows whose
rough, aggressive manners and harsh notes introduce discord into his
naturally calm and peaceful existence. By all means provide a house for
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
this peerless tenant; also be prepared to lend him all possible assistance
in policing his property until the eggs are laid. Once the precious eggs
are deposited, trust the prospective parents to defend their treasure; for
even the Bluebird is no exception to the general rule that a brooding bird
will readily put an erstwhile successful bully to speedy and inglorious
flight. See <a href="#fig5">Plate III</a> and <a href="#Page_16">Table I</a> for housing the Bluebird.</p>
<p>To provide for a second nesting and possibly a third, the procedure
should be the same as that described for the House Wren. See, therefore,
directions given for that species.</p>
<h3 id="c24"><i>Other Bluebirds</i></h3>
<p>The Western Bluebird fills the same role on the ranges and ranches
that is taken on the smaller farms of the east by his eastern namesake.
Build and place the house for the one precisely as for the other. The
western bird seems much more inclined than the eastern to adopt nesting
sites in or close to human dwellings.</p>
<p>The Mountain Bluebird will use the same type of house; its location,
of course, should correspond with the local haunts of the species.</p>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">The Crested Flycatcher</span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="Illustrated capital T" width="165" height="159" />
</div>
<p>There is a peculiar satisfaction in successfully providing
a house for those species, such as the Crested Flycatcher,
which do not ordinarily resort to artificial
nesting sites. It is something of a &ldquo;feather in the cap.&rdquo;
Select a dilapidated orchard or an out-of-the-way woodside as a location
for the Flycatcher&rsquo;s house; place the house and await the results with
expectations not too sanguine. Should fortune favor you with an opportunity
to watch these birds building, remember to look for the famous
dried snake skin almost invariably worked into the nest by this species,
not forgetting that the reason for its use is still one of the mysteries.
Measurements for the Flycatcher&rsquo;s house will be found in <a href="#Page_16">Table I</a>. See
Plates <a href="#fig3">Plate II</a> and <a href="#fig5">Plate III</a> for styles of house recommended.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">The Flicker</span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p11a.jpg" alt="Illustrated capital I" width="163" height="164" />
</div>
<p>In general the woodpeckers choose to build their own
houses. But as the Flicker is so unlike other woodpeckers
in appearance and in certain of his well-known
ways, it is not surprising to learn that he will readily
take possession of an artificial bird house. Naturally, a woodpecker (and
the Flicker is that) is scarcely an exception to the rule that bird-house
tenants prefer something along the general lines of a woodpecker&rsquo;s work.
A section of a hollow trunk or branch of the proper dimensions inside
may easily be transformed into an ideal Flicker house. Next best is the
dugout type illustrated in <a href="#fig3">Plate II</a>. Finally, the semi-cylindrical or even
rectangular house will do very well if the other specifications are about
those given in <a href="#Page_16">Table I</a>. The country or the suburbs, not too near to a
residence, is the right environment for the Flicker.</p>
<p>A Flicker which took possession of a house I had placed for Crested
Flycatchers spent days in audibly widening the rectangular chamber until
a soft bed of chips was provided to receive the eggs. The moral is&mdash;make
the sides of thick, soft wood, and let even a woodpecker furnish his own
bedding. However, one or two handfuls of coarse sawdust thrown into
the Flicker house will be quite welcome to this bird.</p>

</div>
<p>This is the only desirable colony-forming bird-house
tenant. Therefore the apartment type of house is a
waste of material unless intended for Purple Martins
and designed accordingly. Of the desirable bird-house
clientele, none is quite so sophisticated as the Martins
in the matter of a satisfactory location. If it is only so much as a biscuit-toss
from the ground, the martin house may grace a bandstand, a village
railroad station, or a busy village square. The house itself may be one of
those adapted doll houses, complete with chimneys, windows, fancy
doorways, and whatnots, ornate in fluted columns, bizarre in lightning
rods and weathercocks, pretentious with elaborate porches and other
gewgaws, and gaudy with rainbow tints. Go as far as you like, the Martin
will pace you. However, for those who would consider the bird&rsquo;s point of
view to be of greater importance than their own, appropriate suggestions
are offered in <a href="#Page_16">Table I</a> and in <a href="#fig7">Plate IV</a>. If painted white the house will
be cooler and may be preferred by the birds. The reader should be advised
that Martins are temperamental and will sometimes refuse to occupy
a suitable house because of some dislike for its situation. Furthermore,
Martins sometimes inexplicably abandon a locality where they have
previously been abundant.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>
<p>We have alluded to undesirable tenants, meaning usually,
or in particular, the English Sparrow and European
Starling. There is also another class of possible bird-house
occupants to be dealt with&mdash;the owls and the
Sparrow Hawk. The owls and the hawks are usually considered taboo
on account of their fondness for the smaller birds which most persons
wish to encourage. One does not ordinarily keep cats and canaries in the
same restricted and common area and expect pleasing results. Yet, it may
be quite another thing if an estate is large enough to provide sufficient
wild cover. Owls and hawks are as interesting as other birds, and a wood,
suitable in size and character, which lacks the quota of owls or hawks
natural to it will always be lacking in one of its most proper assets and
characteristics. To the true nature lover a great wild forest from which
owls are excluded might seem, at best, an arboretum where there might
as well be a name tag on each tree-trunk.</p>
<p>An occasional nesting site for owls in a wood of many acres, an appropriate
box or two for Sparrow Hawks in a waste tract or along a few
hundred yards of woodside will invite us to visit these places more often
and will provide a new zest to the visits. At the same time, we are but
following nature&rsquo;s way of balancing the wildlife. Nor will the smaller
birds be seriously affected; there may be a tendency for many of them to
move in a little closer toward our dwellings for increased safety.</p>
<p>A house for small owls and the Sparrow Hawk should follow the lines
of the house illustrated in <a href="#fig8">Plate V</a>, size of entrance and other dimensions
being given in <a href="#Page_16">Table I</a>.</p>

<div class="img">

</div>
<p>The several western and extreme southwestern forms of
the native House Finch may, for our present purposes,
be grouped with birds like the Robin and Phoebe
which find such a number and variety of chance but
suitable nesting sites that to provide still others may
seem superfluous effort. And yet, to see the bright red of the Common
House Finch and to hear his cheery song, say, in the heart of a city like
Denver where one looks only for English Sparrows, is to be tempted to
offer this citizen a more &ldquo;desirable property&rdquo; than the water-spout or
other chance nook or cranny in which he may otherwise elect to build.
The most successful is the open or semi-open type of nesting box, as
shown in <a href="#fig10">Plate VI</a>, Nos. 1 and 2.</p>
<h2 id="c31"><span class="small">Robin and Phoebe</span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p14b.jpg" alt="Illustrated capital T" width="162" height="158" />
</div>
<p>These birds are not classed as bird-house tenants. When
they nest in a building, it is nearly always a deserted
human dwelling or some other structure made originally
for man&rsquo;s own use. In other words, the only sort
of bird house at all likely to attract Robin or Phoebe would be one of
cavern-like proportions in keeping with one type of natural site which
both species favor, especially the Phoebe.</p>
<p>The architecture of most human dwellings is such that either Robin
or Phoebe would find nesting-sites, as they often do, over windows,
under porches, or about eaves. But birds are not very considerate of the
human liking for cleanliness, and their nests therefore are often placed
where we least desire them. To lessen that chance and to furnish nesting-sites
when they do not otherwise occur on a given dwelling or outbuilding,
the following suggestions for nesting shelves are offered. The
idea of nesting shelves is not a new one, and experience shows that an
effective nesting shelf may be of almost any description.</p>

Nesting shelves for Robin and Phoebe. See text for directions. The raised rim
shown here is not always essential, but it may aid the birds to get a start, since
high winds are inclined to blow away the first straws from exposed sites.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>The accompanying illustrations will fully explain themselves. However,
it is well to emphasize here that the simplest possible shelf, if only
a mere cleat, is all that is really required&mdash;5 to 6 inches wide for the
Robin, 3&frac12; to 4&frac12; inches wide for the Phoebe; any length of 8 inches or
over for either bird.</p>
<p>The Robin often nests more than 25 feet up, the Phoebe seldom so
high. Place the Phoebe&rsquo;s shelf 8 to 20 feet up, the Robin&rsquo;s 8 to 30 feet.
Should the locality be in the country, one must chance a Phoebe claiming
a shelf intended for Robins; either species should prove desirable as
a tenant. Certainly cultivators of cherries, currants, and other small fruits
may well console themselves should Phoebes become their uninvited
guests! The Phoebe is a true flycatcher and has none of the Robin&rsquo;s
special fondness for garden fruits.</p>

</div>
<p>Birds are inveterate bathers. Bathing is the daily habit
of Robins, Catbirds, goldfinches, Song Sparrows, and
most other small species, whenever facilities are available.
Artificial baths are most important where other
bathing places are distant or inadequate. In times of
drought, birds will resort so eagerly to baths as to form an almost continuous
daily procession.</p>
<p>The bird bath lends itself to endless variations in size, shape, style,
material, and cost. Often one may find a large boulder which, at the
expense of moving to the desired spot, will prove a ready-made bath
if it has a shallowly concave side. Or such a water basin may be chipped
out of a rock by a stone mason. Smaller stones, flattened and more or
less scooped, are common along many streams. One of these stone slabs,
mounted on a pile of supporting stones, makes an excellent bath. Failing
that or as a matter of taste, a massive shallow basin may be cast in
cement to take the place of the natural slab. A pool may be provided
by lining with cement and surrounding with stones a prepared spot in
lawn or garden. See illustrations. If desired, running water may be piped
to any style of bath. Whatever type the bath may be, the following rules
strictly apply.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Depth of water should be graduated from nothing at the edge of
bath or pool to not more than 2&frac12; inches at its deepest; except that in
the case of the larger ground pools it may be graduated up to 5 inches.</p>
<p>2. The bath must be swept or sponged out daily or as often as it
becomes much befouled.</p>
<p>3. Inside of bath should be rough to allow the birds a sure foothold.</p>
<p>4. If the bath is on or near the ground, no shrubbery or other possible
concealment for cats should be within 25 feet of it. It is well also to have
a branchy tree within a few yards of the bath or pool, so that the bathers
when alarmed, may easily reach a place of safety, for their wet plumage
will prove a handicap in longer flights.</p>

</div>
<p>Food is the chief problem of winter birds. Cold alone
is scarcely a menace, while snow and sleet are chiefly
harmful only when they cover up the food. Given
proper food, the only real requirement for a feeding
station from the birds&rsquo; point of view is that it shall keep the food available,
as by providing a roof to shed snow and ice. Among the wide
variety of birds which frequently patronize food stations, various members
of the sparrow and finch family, which includes the grosbeaks,
juncos, and crossbills, vie with nuthatches, chickadees, woodpeckers, and
blue jays as the most dependable boarders.</p>
<p>For winter birds in the northern states, it is well to have the station in
place and stocked with food as early as the first of November. These
birds are then beginning to establish hunting grounds and routes, from
which they will not stray all winter. Earlier in the fall, as again in spring,
ground feeding is the better method. In this, scatter the food (millet,
hemp seed, and so on) in the back yard, along the fence line or at the
edge of shrubbery or thicket. Juncos, Towhees, Song, Fox, and Tree
Sparrows, and many others will benefit. Eagerly devoured by the waxwings
are dried currants and dried raisins. Nearly all birds are fond of
suet. Tie sizable chunks of suet to trees and to posts of food stations;
this appeals especially to woodpeckers, nuthatches, and chickadees. Other
standard foods are millet, hemp seed, sunflower seed, cracked corn, and
bread crumbs. In addition, chaff and oats may be scattered on the
ground for quail, grouse, pheasants, Horned Larks, Snow Buntings,
longspurs, and others in localities wild enough for these birds. Such feeding
is particularly desirable when the snow is covered by an icy crust.
The food may be scattered under brush shelters, made of branchy tree
limbs loosely and irregularly stacked and roughly thatched with pine, fir,
spruce, or other conifer to keep out excess snow.</p>
<p>The care of a food station consists mostly in keeping up a supply of
the proper foods and cleaning out the food trays as often as the condition
suggests. A small separate tray of coarse sand will provide the grit many
birds require. A hopper arrangement for feeding grains aids in keeping
the food supply clean and it helps prevent the scattering of seeds.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
